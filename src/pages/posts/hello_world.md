Welcome to my blog! I thought it would be fitting to name my first blog post after the famous first program someone writes. In that same vein, this will be hopefully the first blog post in a series of many to come in a *hopefully* somewhat regular schedule.

Granted, I don't have to much to say in this first blog post, but this blog was made possible once I got around to porting my website to <a href="https://astro.build/" target="_blank">Astro.js</a> and making use of its static markdown rendering. For anyone curious, all the code for my website can be found <a href="https://github.com/Broyojo/website" target="_blank">here</a>. (Also, I have plans for adding an RSS feed for new blog posts and a commenting system for each blog post, so stay tuned!).

From this blog, you can expect to find content ranging from AI, operating systems, programming languages, low level hardware design, technical Minecraft, and much more. In short, I'll put anything I'm interested in here. I find that I often talk to my friends about these topics that I'm working on anyway all the time, so I think it's about time I have a place to publish my thoughts so 
<ol type="a">
  <li>I'm not repeating them as often</li>
  <li>I get more feedback on ideas</li>
  <li>Hopefully contribute more to the world</li>
</ol>

Anyway, I'm happy that I now have this outlet to share my ideas openly and I look forward to the coming blog posts :)
